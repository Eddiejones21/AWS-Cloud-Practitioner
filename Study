* What is Cloud computing?
- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources. 
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need. 
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly. 
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services. 
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application. 
* Private Cloud 
- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.  
- You have complete control 
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs
* Public Cloud 
- Examples of public cloud providers: Microsoft azure , Google cloud, AWS. 
- Cloud resources are owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet. 
- Six advantages of cloud computing
* Hybrid Cloud
- Keep some servers on premises and extended some x capabilities to the cloud. 
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure. 
- Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud. 

* The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
- On-demand Self Service : Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider. 
- Broad Network Access :Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms. 
- Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling : Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resource. 
- Rapid Elasticity and Scalability : Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed. Quickly and easily scale based on demand. 
- Measure Service: Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used. 
* Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) : Pay on-demand: don’t own hardware. Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX). 
- Benefit From Massive Economies of Sale : Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale. 
- Stop Guessing Capacity : Scale based on actual measured usage. 
- Increase Speed and Agility :
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

Section 4: Identify and Access Management  (IAM)
* IAM: Users and Groups 
- IAM = Identify and Access Management, global service. 
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared. 
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped. 
- Groups only contain users and not other groups. 
- A user does not have to belong to a group, a user can belong to multiple groups. 

* IAM: Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies. 
- These policies define the permissions of the users. 
- In AWS you apply the least priceless principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs.

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
	• Provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
	
	• To connect to an EC2 instance you can use:
	• Secure Shell (SSH) – the most common tool to connect to Linux servers.
	• Session Manager – it is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your EC2 instances, on-premises instances, and virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.
	• EC2 Instance Connect – connect to your Linux instances using a browser-based client.
	

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	• Amazon RDS
	• Amazon ECS
	Platform as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as PaaS, removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
	Amazon RDS and ECS are considered PaaS because you don’t need to worry about setting up servers, storage, and network. You only manage the application and the data.
	
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	• IAAS, or infrastructure as a service, is incorrect. IAAS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IAAS lets you manage your own infrastructure.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
	• SaaS, or software as a service, is incorrect. Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. 

Function as a Service (FaaS)
	• FaaS, or function as a service, is incorrect. Amazon RDS and ECS are not serverless computing services that execute modular pieces of code.

AWS well-architected 6 pillars

	-Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
	-Third-party JDBC-accessible databases
	-MongoDB and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
	-Other marketplace connectors and Apache Spark plugins
	
6 Advantages for using Cloud Computing
	• 1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
	– Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
	• 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
	– By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.
	• 3. Stop guessing capacity
	– Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.
	• 4. Increase speed and agility
	– In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
	• 5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	– Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
	• 6. Go global in minutes
	– Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.
	
Cloud Transformation Value Chain 4 Key Areas
	• Technological transformation involves using the power of cloud computing to optimize and modernize existing IT infrastructure. It enables businesses to quickly adapt to changing market demands, scale resources on demand, and reduce operational complexities.

Vertical Scaling
	• Scaling vertically takes place through an increase in the specifications of an individual resource, such as upgrading a server with a larger hard drive or a faster CPU. With Amazon EC2, you can stop an instance and resize it to an instance type that has more RAM, CPU, I/O, or networking capabilities. This way of scaling can eventually reach a limit, and it is not always a cost-efficient or highly available approach. However, it is very easy to implement and can be sufficient for many use cases especially in the short term.
	
Horizontal Scaling
	• Scaling horizontally takes place through an increase in the number of resources, such as adding more hard drives to a storage array or adding more servers to support an application. This is a great way to build internet-scale applications that leverage the elasticity of cloud computing. Take note that not all architectures are designed to distribute their workload to multiple resources.
