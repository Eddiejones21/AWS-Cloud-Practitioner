Section 3: What is Cloud Computing?
* What is a server composed of?
- Compute: CPU
- Memory: RAM
- Storage: Data
- Database: Store data in a structured way. 
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server
* IT Terminology 
- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other. 
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the Internet. 
- Switch: takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your town. 

* What is Cloud computing?
- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources. 
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need. 
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly. 
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services. 
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application. 
* Private Cloud 
- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.  
- You have complete control 
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs
* Public Cloud 
- Examples of public cloud providers: Microsoft azure , Google cloud, AWS. 
- Cloud resources are owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet. 
- Six advantages of cloud computing
* Hybrid Cloud
- Keep some servers on premises and extended some x capabilities to the cloud. 
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure. 
- Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud. 

* The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
- On-demand Self Service : Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider. 
- Broad Network Access :Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms. 
- Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling : Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resource. 
- Rapid Elasticity and Scalability : Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed. Quickly and easily scale based on demand. 
- Measure Service: Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used. 
* Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) : Pay on-demand: don’t own hardware. Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX). 
- Benefit From Massive Economies of Sale : Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale. 
- Stop Guessing Capacity : Scale based on actual measured usage. 
- Increase Speed and Agility :
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes : leverage the AWS global infrastructure

* Problems solved by the cloud
- Flexibility : change resource types when needed. 
- Cost-Effectiveness : pay as you go, for what you use. 
- Scalability : Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes. 
- Elasticity : ability to scale out and scale-in when needed 
- High-availability and fault tolerance : Build across data centers. 
- Agility :  rapidly develop, test and launch software applications. 

* Types of cloud computing 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : providing building blocks for cloud IT. Provides networking, computers, data storage space.  Example: Amazon EC2 (on AWS), google cloud, Azure, rack space, digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) : Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focuses on the deployment and management of your applications. Example: Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, google app engine (GCP), windows azure (Microsoft). 
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. Example: Many AWS services, Rekognition for machine learning, google apps (gmail), Dropbox, zoom. 

* Pricing of the Cloud
- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model. 
- Compute : Pay for compute time. 
- Storage : Pay for data storage in the cloud. 
- Data Transfer Out of the Cloud : Data transfer in the cloud is free. 
-  Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT. 
* AWS Cloud Uses:
- AWS enables you to build sophisticated, scalable applications. 
- Applicable to a diverse set of industries. 
- Use cases include: Enterprise IT, backup and storage, big data analytics, web hosting, mobile and social apps, gaming. 
* AWS Global Infrastructure 
- AWS regions 
- AWS availability zones
- AWS data centers
- AWS Eddie Locations/ Points of presence
* AWS Regions
- AWS had regions all over the world
- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3
- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region scoped 
* How to choose an AWS Region
- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission. 
- Proximity to customers: reduced latency. 
- Available Services within a region: new services and new features aren’t available in every region. 
- Pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing range. 
* AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, 3 min, max is 6). Example: ap-southeast-2a , ap-southeast-2b , ap-southeast-2c
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. 
- They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters. 
- They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra low latency networking. 
* AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
- Amazon had 400+ Points if Presence (499+ Edge locations and 10+ regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries. 
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency. 
* AWS Global Services 
- Identify and Access Management  (IAM)
- Route 53 (DNS service)
- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network) 
- WAF (Web application firewall) 
* Most AWS services are region-scoped
- Amazon EC2 (infrastructure as a service)
- Elastic beanstalk (platform as a service )
- Lambda (function as a service)
- Rekognition 

* Shared Responsibility Model
- Customer is responsible for the security in the cloud: Customer data, platform, applications, identity & access management, operating system, network and firewall configuration. Client-side data encryption and data integrity authentication, server-side encryption (file system and/or data) , networking traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity). 
- AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud: software, compute, storage, database, networking, hardware/AWS global infrastructure, regions, availability zones, edge locations.

- Identity and Access Management  (IAM). 
* What is a definition of cloud computing? 
- On-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. 
* What defines the distribution of responsibilities for security in the AWS cloud?
- The shared responsibility model. 
* A company would like to benefit from the advantages of the public cloud but would like to keep sensitive assists in its own infrastructure. Which deployment model should the company use? 
- A hybrid cloud deployment model, allows you to benefit from the flexibility, scalability and on-demand storage access while keeping security and performance of your own infrastructure. 
* What is NOT authorized to do on AWS Acceptable Use Policy?
- Run analytics on stolen content. 

Section 4: Identify and Access Management  (IAM)
* IAM: Users and Groups 
- IAM = Identify and Access Management, global service. 
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared. 
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped. 
- Groups only contain users and not other groups. 
- A user does not have to belong to a group, a user can belong to multiple groups. 

* IAM: Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies. 
- These policies define the permissions of the users. 
- In AWS you apply the least priceless principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs.
